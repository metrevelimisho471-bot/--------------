                <h1>Privacy Policy - the basics</h1>

                <p>Having said that, a privacy policy is a statement that discloses some or all<br> of the ways a website collects, uses, discloses, processes, and manages the<br> data of its visitors and customers. It usually also includes a statement<br> regarding the website’s commitment to protecting its visitors’ or<br> customers’ privacy, and an explanation about the different mechanisms<br> the website is implementing in order to protect privacy. 
<br><br>
Different jurisdictions have different legal obligations of what must be<br> included in a Privacy Policy. You are responsible to make sure you<br> are following the relevant legislation to your activities and location. </p>

            <div class="include">
                <h1>What to include in the Privacy Policy</h1>

                <p>Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses these types of issues:<br> the types of information the website is collecting and the manner in<br> which it collects the data; an explanation about why is the website<br> collecting these types of information; what are the website’s practices on<br> sharing the information with third parties; ways in which your visitors<br> and customers can exercise their rights according to the relevant privacy<br> legislation; the specific practices regarding minors’ data collection; and <br>much, much more.
